Array size: 1600 MB

read 256 times, from cold to warm

1) stride = 32 MB, * 49
	a. L1+L2 TLB miss, cache miss)
	b. L1+L2 TLB miss, page table "miss", cache miss)
	
set the 1568 MB entry points to 1569 MB
	
2) stride = 1 MB, * 16
	a.  * (L1+L2 TLB miss, cache miss)
	c.  * (L1 TLB hit, cache miss)
	alternate
set the 1598 MB entry point to 1599 MB, and 1599 MB entry point to the second element, 4 byte. 
Up to now, The L2 TLB entry is full. The following read data are all cached in L2, entry all cached in L2 TLB

3) stride = 32 MB * 48
	d. ( L1 TLB miss, L2 TLB hit, cache hit)
Now the read goes to 1568 MB + 4 byte. 
The L2 TLB is full with each entry visited twice

//4) stride = 2MB
//	e. L2 TLB miss, cache hit
// mapping algorithm is rather random, difficult to generate


5) 1568 MB cache line, initialized as: |1569 MB|1568MB+4*2byte|1568MB+4*3 byte|1568 MB + 4 * 1 byte|, so that there would be a circle, all read are 
	e. (L1 TLB + L2 cache hit)
until to the end.
